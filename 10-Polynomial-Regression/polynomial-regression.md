### Lecture Summary: Introduction to Polynomial Regression

#### Instructor’s Introduction
- **Focus:** Understanding polynomial regression and its motivation.
- **Previous Topic:** We completed a linear regression task for predicting label values based on features.

#### Motivation for Polynomial Regression
- **Limitations of Linear Regression:** Linear regression works well for linear relationships but struggles with non-linear patterns and interactions between features. 

1. **Non-Linear Relationships:**
   - Many real-world relationships are not linear; for instance, the relationship between a feature \( x \) and a target variable might resemble a logarithmic curve.
   - In such cases, applying linear regression directly may not yield a good fit. The model would have difficulty determining a beta coefficient that accurately captures the underlying pattern.
   - **Higher Order Polynomials:** By transforming the feature into higher powers (e.g., \( x^2 \), \( x^3 \)), the relationship can be better approximated as linear. 
     - **Example:** If \( x \) behaves like \( \log(x) \), using \( x^2 \) or \( x^3 \) can yield a more linear appearance, allowing for effective modeling of the relationship and more accurate estimates of the coefficients.

2. **Interaction Terms:**
   - Interaction terms allow us to model situations where the effect of one feature depends on another feature. This is particularly relevant in cases where features work together to influence the outcome, known as synergy.
   - **Example:** Consider TV advertising spend (feature \( x_1 \)) and newspaper advertising spend (feature \( x_2 \)). 
     - Alone, either may have limited impact on sales, but together, they can create a significant boost in sales when used in combination. 
   - **Creating Interaction Terms:** To capture this synergy, we can create a new feature that is the product of the two features (i.e., \( x_1 \times x_2 \)). This interaction term reflects the combined effect of the two features.

#### Polynomial Features in Scikit-Learn
- **Preprocessing Tools:** Scikit-Learn provides a `PolynomialFeatures` class that simplifies the process of creating polynomial and interaction terms for our feature set.
  
- **What Polynomial Features Creates:**
  - **Bias Term:** It includes a constant term of 1, which represents the intercept of the regression model.
  - **Higher Order Terms:** It raises each feature to a specified power, allowing us to model more complex relationships. For example:
    - If we specify a polynomial order of 2, it generates terms like \( x_1^2 \) and \( x_2^2 \).
  - **Interaction Features:** It generates all possible products of pairs of features. For two features, \( x_1 \) and \( x_2 \), it will create \( x_1 \times x_2 \).

#### Example of Polynomial Features
- **Dataset Example:** Suppose we have two features, A and B.
- **Using Polynomial Features with Order 2:**
  - Input: \( A, B \)
  - Output: \( [1, A, B, A^2, B^2, A \times B] \)
    - This transformation enhances our dataset by not only preserving the original features but also introducing new dimensions that can better capture the complexities of the relationships within the data.
  
- **Specific Row Example:**
  - Given \( A = 2 \) and \( B = 3 \):
    - Output: \( [1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 6] \) 
      - This expands our feature set from 2 to 6, enriching the dataset and providing the regression model with more information to work with. Each term contributes to the model's ability to identify and quantify relationships between the features and the target variable.

#### Conclusion
- **Exploration of Signals:** Polynomial regression can potentially uncover more intricate relationships in the data, but there’s no guarantee that significant signals will be found. It’s essential to experiment with different model configurations to discover the most effective representation of the data.





### Lab Lecture Summary: Setting Up Polynomial Regression

#### Instructor Introduction
- **Focus of the Lecture:** Learn how to create polynomial terms using Scikit-Learn and Python.
- **Recap:** Previous discussions covered the motivation for using interaction terms and higher-order terms in regression models.

---

### 1. Environment Setup
- **Importing Libraries:**
  ```python
  import numpy as np
  import pandas as pd
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
  import seaborn as sns
  ```

- **Reading Data:**
  - Load the dataset `Advertising.csv`, which includes three features: TV, radio, and newspaper advertising spends, along with the target variable, sales.

---

### 2. Data Preparation
- **Separating Features and Target:**
  - To prepare for polynomial regression, we first separate the feature set (X) from the target variable (y).
  ```python
  # Load dataset
  df = pd.read_csv('Advertising.csv')

  # Separate features and target
  X = df.drop('sales', axis=1)  # All features
  y = df['sales']  # Target variable
  ```

---

### 3. Creating Polynomial Features
- **Importing PolynomialFeatures:**
  ```python
  from sklearn.preprocessing import PolynomialFeatures
  ```

- **Instantiating PolynomialFeatures:**
  - Set up the polynomial converter with specified parameters.
  ```python
  polynomial_converter = PolynomialFeatures(degree=2, include_bias=False)
  ```
  - **Parameters Explained:**
    - `degree`: Determines the highest power of the polynomial features (default is 2).
    - `include_bias`: If set to True, includes a bias column (default is True). In this case, we set it to False as it won't be necessary for linear regression.

---

### 4. Fitting and Transforming the Data

- **Fit and Transforming the Data:**
  - To actually create the polynomial features, we call the fit_transform method.
  The fit method is used to define the data range, while the transform method applies that definition to create the new dataset.For convenience, both actions can be performed in one step using `fit_transform`.
  
  ```python
  poly_features = polynomial_converter.fit_transform(X)
  ```

- **Verifying the Transformation:**
  - Check the shape of the transformed features.
  ```python
  print(poly_features.shape)  # Should output (200, 9)
  ```

---

### 5. Understanding the Transformed Features
- **Analyzing the First Row:**
  - Compare the first row of the original features with the first row of the transformed features.
  ```python
  # Original first row
  original_row = X.iloc[0]
  
  # Transformed first row
  transformed_row = poly_features[0]
  ```

- **Breakdown of Transformed Features:**
  - The transformed features include:
    - **Original Features:** The first three values correspond to the original features (e.g., TV, radio, newspaper).
    - **Interaction Terms:** The next three values are the products of the original features (e.g., TV * radio).
    - **Squared Terms:** The last three values are the squares of the original features.

---

### 6. Summary of Polynomial Features Creation
- **Feature Expansion:**
  - The transformation process increases the number of features from 3 to 9, which enhances the model's ability to capture complex relationships in the data.

### 8. Next Steps
- **Preparing for Linear Regression:**
  - The next lecture will cover performing a train-test split on the polynomial features and fitting a linear regression model, effectively implementing polynomial regression.

---

### 1. Introduction to Model Complexity
- **Key Concepts:**
  - **Bias-Variance Trade-Off:** Balancing between underfitting (high bias) and overfitting (high variance).
  - **Objective:** To determine the appropriate degree for polynomial features that optimizes model performance without overfitting.

---

### 2. Looping Through Polynomial Degrees
- **Overview of Steps:**
  1. Create polynomial features for various degrees.
  2. Split the polynomial feature set into training and test sets.
  3. Fit a model to the training data.
  4. Calculate error metrics (RMSE) for both training and test datasets.
  5. Plot the results to visualize performance against polynomial degree.

---

  ```

#### 4. Initializing Error Lists
- **Create Lists to Store Errors:**
  ```python
  train_rmse_list = []
  test_rmse_list = []
  ```

#### 5. Looping Through Polynomial Degrees
- **Defining the Range of Degrees:**
  ```python
  for d in range(1, 11):  # Testing polynomial degrees from 1 to 10
      poly_converter = PolynomialFeatures(degree=d, include_bias=False)
      poly_features = poly_converter.fit_transform(X)  # Transform features
  ```

#### 6. Train-Test Split and Model Fitting

  X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(poly_features, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=101)
  ```

- **Fitting the Linear Regression Model:**
  ```python
  model = LinearRegression()
  model.fit(X_train, y_train)
  ```

---

### 7. Predictions and Error Calculation
- **Making Predictions:**
  ```python
  train_predictions = model.predict(X_train)
  test_predictions = model.predict(X_test)
  ```

- **Calculating RMSE:**
  ```python
  train_rmse = np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(y_train, train_predictions))
  test_rmse = np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(y_test, test_predictions))
  ```

- **Storing RMSE Values:**

  plt.xlabel('Degree of Polynomial')
  plt.ylabel('Root Mean Squared Error')
  plt.title('RMSE vs. Polynomial Degree')
  plt.legend()
  plt.show()
  ```

- **Analysis of the Plot:**
  - Training RMSE generally decreases as the degree increases.
  - Test RMSE may spike after a certain degree, indicating overfitting.

---

### 9. Interpreting Results
- **Choosing the Optimal Degree:**
  - Degrees that show good performance without significant spikes in test RMSE are preferred.
  - The instructor recommends against high-degree polynomials for datasets with limited features, highlighting that domain knowledge is critical in this decision.

---

### 10. Final Recommendations
- **Selecting the Polynomial Degree:**
  - Opt for lower-degree polynomials (e.g., 2 or 3) based on visual insights and the context of the data.
  
- **Next Steps:**
  - The upcoming session will finalize the model choice (likely degree 3) and demonstrate how to save both the polynomial converter and the trained model.
