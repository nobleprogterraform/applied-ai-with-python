### Overview of Missing Data in Pandas

1. **Introduction to Missing Data**:
   - In the real world, datasets are frequently missing values for various reasons. As noted, "real world data sets are often going to be missing data."
   - This presents a challenge because many machine learning models and statistical methods "cannot work with missing data points." They require some number to be present.

2. **Representation of Missing Data**:
   - When dealing with missing values in pandas, they are represented as `NaN`, which stands for "not a number." 
   - The lecture also points out that newer versions of pandas introduce specialized null values, such as `pd.NaT`, meaning "not a timestamp." This specificity helps indicate that the missing value should be of a particular type, such as a timestamp in datasets like stock ticker data.

3. **Options for Handling Missing Data**:
   - There are three primary strategies to manage missing data:
     - **Keep the Missing Data**: 
       - **Pros**: This approach is straightforward: "You just read in the data and that's it." It doesn’t manipulate or alter the true data. You can report that a value is missing when using the dataset.
       - **Cons**: However, many methods do not support `NaN` values. While some machine learning methods can handle them, many cannot. Additionally, there are often reasonable guesses available for filling in missing data. For instance, if a product's price is logged as `NaN` during a giveaway, it may be more accurate to record it as zero.
       
     - **Drop the Missing Data**: 
       - **Pros**: This method is also easy to execute. "Pandas makes it really easy to either drop a row that's missing some data or drop an entire column." You can establish rules, such as dropping a row that is missing two or more data points.
       - **Cons**: A significant drawback is the risk of losing valuable information. If you drop too many rows or important columns, "you have the potential to lose a lot of data." This can affect model training, especially if missing features become relevant later.
       - **Guidelines**:
         - It's often advisable to drop a row when substantial information about that row is missing. For example, if only the year is present for a country and other key data points like population and GDP are missing, that row might be dropped.
         - Conversely, dropping a feature column is wise when most rows lack that specific value. For example, if the area data is missing for many countries, it may be better to drop the area column rather than lose complete rows with valuable data.

     - **Replace the Missing Data**:
       - **Pros**: Filling in missing data can help retain more data points for training a model. 
       - **Cons**: However, this is often the most complex option and can be somewhat arbitrary. As highlighted, "at the end of the day, if you're filling in missing data with some sort of statistical estimation, you are in fact just making up a number." It's crucial to be cautious to avoid leading to false conclusions.
       - **Filling Strategies**:
         - One common method is to replace `NaN` values with a constant, like zero, if that makes sense in context. For instance, if two countries have zero aircraft carriers, representing that as `NaN` may be misleading; it's more accurate to use zero.
         - Another option is interpolation, which estimates missing values based on existing data points. And what it does is it just does a linear interpolation from the point above and the point below. So it's gonna fill this in with a linear interpolation between 50 and 100, which is essentially the average between 100 and 50, which is gonna be 75..

4. **Future Discussions**:
   - The next part of the course will explore the syntax and implementation of these strategies in pandas. The lecture emphasizes that there will be a deeper discussion on choosing among these options as part of feature engineering in future sections. "We’re gonna have a deeper discussion on trying to decide between keeping, removing, and replacing options for a real dataset."

### Handling Missing Data in Pandas: Lecture Summary

1. **Introduction to Missing Data**:
   - The lecture focuses on practical ways to handle missing data using pandas in a Jupyter Notebook environment. The speaker emphasizes the importance of understanding how to manage `NaN` values, stating, "we're gonna head straight to the Jupyter Notebook and show you how to either keep missing data, replace missing data, or drop missing data all with Pandas."

2. **Representation of Missing Values**:
   - In the current pandas version used for the course, missing values are represented by `np.nan`. The instructor notes that while newer versions may use `pd.NA` or specialized values like `pd.NaT` for timestamps, for now, they will focus on `np.nan` for simplicity.

3. **Comparison of Missing Values**:
   - The speaker cautions against using typical comparisons with `NaN`: "If you say np.nan and check for equality with np.nan, often, beginners will think that this should be true. But in reality, it's actually false." Instead, the correct method to check for `NaN` is by using `myvar is np.nan`, which returns true if `myvar` is missing.

4. **Reading a Dataset with Missing Values**:
   - The example dataset, `movie_scores.csv`, includes actors' names, ages, genders, and scores from surveys, but contains missing values. The instructor explains how to read in this dataset with `pd.read_csv` and highlights specific rows where data is missing, such as "the second row at index 1 is missing all the values."

5. **Identifying Missing Data**:
   - To check for missing values, the speaker demonstrates using `df.isnull()`, which returns a Boolean DataFrame indicating the presence of `NaN` values. For example, "true for every item in row 1 where they were all null values." The opposite can be checked with `df.notnull()`, returning false for nulls and true for non-nulls.

6. **Conditional Filtering**:
   - The lecture covers how to filter DataFrames based on missing values. For instance, to find actors with a non-missing `pre_movie_score`, one can use conditional filtering with `df[‘pre_movie_score’].notnull()`, which returns only the relevant rows.

7. **Options for Handling Missing Data**:
   - The instructor outlines three main strategies: 
     - **Keep the Data**: Simply retain the dataset as it is, including any missing values. "You just read in the data and that's it."
     - **Drop the Data**: Utilize `df.dropna()` to remove rows or columns with missing values. Important parameters include:
       - **axis**: Determines whether to drop rows (`axis=0`) or columns (`axis=1`).
       - **threshold**: Requires a specified number of non-null values to keep a row/column.
       - **subset**: Allows specifying certain columns to consider for dropping.
       - An example is provided where dropping rows with any null values is shown: "If I just say dropna, essentially what it's gonna do is it's gonna drop any rows that have any missing values."

     - **Fill the Data**: The fillna method is introduced for filling in missing values. The instructor notes, "you could just say, df.fillna, and then just provide a single value that would fill in every single missing point." However, the more effective approach is to fill specific columns, such as replacing `NaN` in `pre_movie_score` with a default value like 0.

8. **Using Mean or Functions to Fill Missing Data**:
   - The speaker demonstrates how to fill missing values using the mean of existing values: "If I want to fill in these null values with the average pre_movie_score, I can simply say df[‘pre_movie_score’].mean().fillna(...)." This method allows for more informed filling of missing values rather than arbitrary choices.

9. **Interpolation**:
   - The lecture briefly touches on the `interpolate` method for estimating missing values based on existing data points. The instructor explains this technique with a series of airline ticket prices, stating, "it might make sense to try to interpolate this, assuming it's already in the correct order."

10. **Conclusion**:
    - The speaker summarizes key points, emphasizing not to use equality comparisons with `NaN` and to utilize the `isnull` and `notnull` methods for identification. Finally, the importance of `dropna` and `fillna` is reiterated as essential tools in managing missing data throughout the course.
