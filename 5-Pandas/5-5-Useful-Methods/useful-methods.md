### Useful Methods in Pandas: Part 1 - The `apply` Method

**Introduction to Series and DataFrame Methods:**
- In this series of lecture videos, we delve into various specialized methods in Pandas, aimed at enhancing data manipulation skills.
- The series focuses on dividing these methods into manageable topics, with a linked lecture notebook available for easy navigation to specific sections.

**Overview of the `apply` Method:**
- The `apply` method is introduced as one of the most useful tools in Pandas. Understanding this method correctly can significantly boost your Pandas skills, akin to how conditional filtering enhances data handling.
- Essentially, the `apply` method allows you to apply any custom Python function to every row in a Series, making it possible to process data in a flexible and powerful way.

**Practical Example - Extracting Last Four Digits of a Credit Card Number:**
1. **Casting Integer to String:**
   - To demonstrate, consider a DataFrame containing credit card numbers stored as integers. The challenge arises because integers cannot be indexed like strings. Attempting to index an integer will result in an error stating, "this integer object is not subscriptable."
   - To work around this, you first need to convert the integer to a string. This is crucial as it enables the use of string slicing.

2. **Creating a Custom Function (`last_four`):**
   - You can define a custom function called `last_four` that takes a number as input. This function converts the number to a string and extracts the last four digits using slice notation: `[-4:]`.
   - For example, if you run the function with the number `123456789`, it successfully returns the string `6789`.

3. **Applying the Function:**
   - To apply this function across the entire credit card number column, you use the syntax `df['column_name'].apply(last_four)`. 
   - This operation will return a Series containing the last four digits of each credit card number, which can then be saved in a new column if desired.

**Creating Categorical Features:**
- Another practical example involves creating a categorical feature to represent restaurant pricing, similar to what review sites like Yelp might use.
- You can define a function that categorizes total bill amounts into dollar signs: 
  - If the total bill is less than $10, it returns one dollar sign; between $10 and $30, it returns two dollar signs; and for amounts greater than $30, it returns three dollar signs.
- This approach allows you to convert a continuous variable (total bill) into a categorical one, thereby simplifying the data for further analysis.

**Handling Multiple Columns:**
- The lecture emphasizes that, while the examples so far only involve single-column functions, the next session will cover how to create functions that depend on multiple columns. 
- This is particularly useful when you want to perform calculations based on relationships between different data points, like deriving a tip percentage from both the tip and total bill columns.

**Common Pitfalls:**
- A crucial point to note is that custom functions used with `apply` should return a single value for each input, not an entire Series. Beginners often mistakenly try to return a Series, but the function must yield a single output for each row in the DataFrame.

### Conclusion
- The `apply` method is a powerful tool in Pandas that allows for custom transformations on DataFrame elements, enabling users to implement complex logic and data manipulations easily.
- Understanding and utilizing this method effectively can greatly enhance your data processing capabilities in Python.

### Useful Methods in Pandas: Part 2 - The `apply` Method with Multiple Columns

**Introduction to Part 2:**
- Welcome back to the second part of our series on useful methods in Pandas. In the previous lecture, we explored the `apply` method, which allows us to utilize custom functions on individual columns or Series. This session aims to extend that knowledge by demonstrating how to apply functions across multiple columns.

**Review of Lambda Expressions:**
- Before diving into multiple columns, we briefly review Lambda expressions, which are essential for our upcoming examples.
- A Lambda expression is an anonymous function defined with the `lambda` keyword. For instance, if we want a function that doubles a number, we can create it as:
  ```python
  simple = lambda x: x * 2
  ```
- This function can be applied directly to a value like `2`, returning `4`. Lambda expressions are concise and useful for one-time operations, especially in Pandas for quick transformations.

**Applying Functions Across Multiple Columns:**
- To illustrate applying a function to multiple columns, we'll create a custom function to categorize tips based on their relation to the total bill.
- First, we define a function named `quality` that takes in the `total_bill` and `tip` as arguments. The function checks if the tip is greater than 25% of the total bill:
  ```python
  def quality(total_bill, tip):
      if (tip / total_bill) > 0.25:
          return 'generous'
      else:
          return 'other'
  ```

**Using `apply` with Multiple Columns:**
- To apply the `quality` function across the `total_bill` and `tip` columns, we structure our `apply` method using a Lambda expression. Here’s how it looks:
  ```python
  df['quality'] = df.apply(lambda row: quality(row['total_bill'], row['tip']), axis=1)
  ```
- The `axis=1` argument tells Pandas to apply the function across rows (i.e., to columns). This method can be expanded to include more columns as needed.

**Common Errors and Typos:**
- It's important to be careful with syntax, as typos can easily lead to errors, especially when dealing with multiple parentheses and commas in function calls. If you encounter issues, referring back to the notebook for correct examples can help resolve them.

**Performance Considerations with `np.vectorize`:**
- After demonstrating the `apply` method, the lecture introduces `np.vectorize`, a NumPy function that allows for faster computation of custom functions by making them aware of NumPy arrays.
- Using `np.vectorize`, we can rewrite our tip quality assignment like this:
  ```python
  df['quality'] = np.vectorize(quality)(df['total_bill'], df['tip'])
  ```
- This approach is often faster, particularly for large datasets, because it optimizes the function to handle operations on entire arrays rather than individual elements.

**Understanding `np.vectorize`:**
- Despite the NumPy documentation stating that `np.vectorize` is primarily for convenience, the distinction arises from the way it transforms standard Python functions to be more efficient when operating on NumPy arrays. This means it allows functions that are not originally designed to handle arrays to perform better when applied to them.

**Performance Testing with `timeit`:**
- To compare the performance of both methods, the lecture demonstrates using the `timeit` module, which executes a piece of code repeatedly to measure its execution time.
- The setup code imports the necessary libraries and defines the DataFrame and function. Two separate statements are created to time the Lambda expression method and the `np.vectorize` method, respectively.
- Upon execution, the `np.vectorize` method typically shows a significant performance improvement, especially noticeable with larger DataFrames.

### Conclusion:
- In summary, mastering the `apply` method with multiple columns and utilizing `np.vectorize` can greatly enhance data manipulation efficiency in Pandas. Understanding how to structure these methods allows for flexible, powerful data processing and can lead to better performance in handling larger datasets.

### Key Points on Statistical Methods and Sorting in Pandas:

1. **General Description Methods:**
   - Use `df.describe()` for a statistical summary of numeric columns.
   - Not all columns are suitable for statistical methods (e.g., credit card numbers vs. total bills).

2. **Transposing for Readability:**
   - Transposing the description output can enhance readability.

3. **Sorting DataFrames:**
   - Use `df.sort_values(by='column_name')` to sort by a specific column.
   - To sort in descending order, set `ascending=False`.
   - Sorting does not modify the original DataFrame; it returns a sorted view.

4. **Sorting by Multiple Columns:**
   - Pass a list of columns to `sort_values()` to sort by multiple criteria sequentially.

5. **Finding Min/Max Values:**
   - Use `df['column_name'].max()` to find the maximum value.
   - Use `df['column_name'].idxmax()` to find the index of the maximum value, which can be used to access the entire row.

6. **Correlation Checks:**
   - `df.corr()` computes pairwise correlations between numeric columns.
   - Correlation values range from -1 to 1.

7. **Value Counts:**
   - Use `df['categorical_column'].value_counts()` to count occurrences of each category.
   - The `unique()` method returns unique values, while `nunique()` counts them.

8. **Replacing Values:**
   - Use `df['column'].replace()` for simple value replacements.
   - For multiple replacements, create a mapping dictionary and use `df['column'].map()`.

9. **Handling Duplicates:**
   - `df.duplicated()` identifies duplicate rows.
   - Use `df.drop_duplicates()` to remove subsequent duplicates.

10. **Filtering Values:**
    - The `between()` method checks if values in a column fall within specified limits, and can be used for conditional filtering.

11. **Finding Largest/Smallest Values:**
    - Use `df.nlargest(n, 'column_name')` and `df.nsmallest(n, 'column_name')` to quickly retrieve the top or bottom N values in a specified column.

12. **Random Sampling:**
    - Use `df.sample(n)` to randomly sample a specific number of rows or `df.sample(frac)` to sample a fraction of the DataFrame.
