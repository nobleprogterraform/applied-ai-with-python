### Summary of Operations on Pandas DataFrames

**Introduction:**
- The lecture focuses on key operations for working with pandas DataFrames, covering both fundamental and advanced functionalities.
- The instructor utilizes a Jupyter notebook to demonstrate these operations through code examples.

**Creating the DataFrame:**
- A sample DataFrame is created with three columns: `call_1`, `call_2`, and `call_3`, indexed by numbers from 0 to 3. 
- The contents of the DataFrame include integers in `call_1`, a repetition of the integer 4 in `call_2`, and strings in `call_3`.

### Finding Unique Values
- **Methods for Unique Values**: 
  1. **`unique()`**: Returns an array of unique values in a specified column.
     ```python
     df['call_2'].unique()
     ```
  2. **`nunique()`**: Returns the count of unique values directly.
     ```python
     df['call_2'].nunique()
     ```
  3. **`value_counts()`**: Provides a count of each unique value in the column.
     ```python
     df['call_2'].value_counts()
     ```
- **Usage**: These methods are frequently used for data exploration and cleaning.

### Selecting Data
- **Conditional Selection**: 
  - The instructor emphasizes its importance for filtering DataFrames. For example, selecting rows where `call_1` is greater than 2:
    ```python
    df[df['call_1'] > 2]
    ```
  - Conditions can be combined using parentheses with logical operators (ampersand `&` for AND, pipe `|` for OR).

### Applying Functions
- **`apply()` Method**: 
  - A powerful tool for applying custom functions or built-in functions to DataFrame columns.
  - For instance, to multiply each value in a column by 2:
    ```python
    df['call_2'].apply(lambda x: x * 2)
    ```
  - You can also apply built-in functions like `len()` to compute the length of strings in `call_3`.

### Removing Columns
- **Dropping Columns**:
  - To remove a column from a DataFrame, use the `drop()` method:
    ```python
    df.drop('call_1', axis=1, inplace=True)
    ```
  - The `inplace=True` parameter modifies the original DataFrame rather than returning a new one.

### Retrieving Column and Index Names
- **Accessing Names**: 
  - To retrieve column names, use:
    ```python
    df.columns
    ```
  - For index information, use:
    ```python
    df.index
    ```

### Sorting Data
- **Sorting with `sort_values()`**: 
  - This method sorts the DataFrame based on specified column values. For instance, sorting by `call_2`:
    ```python
    df.sort_values(by='call_2')
    ```
  - The original index is retained to ensure data integrity.

### Handling Missing Values
- **Identifying Nulls**:
  - Use the `isnull()` method to check for missing values:
    ```python
    df.isnull()
    ```

### Pivot Tables
- **Creating Pivot Tables**:
  - The instructor demonstrates how to create a pivot table similar to Excel, allowing for data summarization.
  - The `pivot_table()` method takes parameters for values, index, and columns. An example is provided:
    ```python
    df.pivot_table(values='D', index=['A', 'B'], columns='C')
    ```
  - This creates a multi-index DataFrame based on the specified columns, summarizing data points.

### Conclusion
- The lecture encapsulates a variety of essential operations in pandas, equipping users with the knowledge to manipulate and analyze DataFrames effectively.
- Students are encouraged to explore the operations notebook for reference and practice.

**Final Note**: While pivot tables are introduced, they are not heavily utilized in the course, but familiarity with them can be beneficial, especially for those with a background in Excel.
