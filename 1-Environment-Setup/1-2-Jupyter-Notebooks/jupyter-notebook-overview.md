### Jupyter Notebook Overview Session (20 Minutes)

#### 1. Introduction (2 minutes)
   - **Welcome Everyone**
     - “Hello everyone and welcome to the Jupyter Notebook lecture! Today, we'll explore how to effectively use the Jupyter Notebook system and tour the overall environment.”
   - **Resources Reminder**
     - “Make sure to check out the resources for this lecture to download the zip file containing all the notebook files you'll need for the course.”

#### 2. Downloading Notebook Files (2 minutes)
   - **Locate and Unzip Files**
     - “Please download the zip file, unzip it, and remember where you saved it. This file contains all the .ipynb files for our course.”

#### 3. Opening a Jupyter Notebook (4 minutes)
   - **Starting Jupyter Notebook**
     - “Let’s start by opening a Jupyter Notebook. If you're on Windows, open your command prompt; for Mac users, use the terminal.”
     - **Command to Run:**
       - “Type `jupyter notebook` and hit enter. This will launch Jupyter Notebook in your browser.”
   - **Navigating to Your Folder**
     - “If you want to start in a specific directory, you can change directories using `cd [folder_name]`. For example, if you want to navigate to your Downloads folder, type `cd Downloads` and hit enter.”

#### 4. Understanding the Command Line (3 minutes)
   - **Listing Files**
     - “To list files in your current directory: 
       - On Windows, use `dir`.
       - On Mac, use `ls`.”
   - **Clearing the Screen**
     - “To clear your command line:
       - Windows: `cls`
       - Mac: `clear`.”

#### 5. Exploring Jupyter Notebook (3 minutes)
   - **Navigating the Interface**
     - “Once Jupyter opens, locate the folder where you unzipped your course materials. You should see various folders for topics like Python Crash Course, Data Visualization, and more.”
   - **Opening Notebooks**
     - “For example, go into the 'Python Crash Course' folder and click on the notebook file you want to open.”

#### 6. Creating and Naming a New Notebook (2 minutes)
   - **Creating a New Notebook**
     - “To create a new notebook, click on 'New' and select Python 3.”
   - **Renaming the Notebook**
     - “Click on 'Untitled' at the top to rename your notebook. For instance, name it ‘My Notebook’.”

#### 7. Basic Operations in Jupyter Notebook (4 minutes)
   - **Using Code Cells**
     - “In a code cell, you can type Python code. For example, type `print("Hello, World!")`.”
     - **Running Cells**
       - “You can run the cell by clicking 'Run' or using the shortcut `Shift + Enter`.”
   - **Executing Multiple Commands**
     - “If you want to run a simple calculation like `1 + 1`, just type it and hit 'Run' or `Shift + Enter`. It will show the output below.”
   - **Inserting New Cells**
     - “If you want to insert a new cell below, use `Alt + Enter` after running a cell.”

#### 8. Saving and Exporting Notebooks (3 minutes)
   - **Saving Your Work**
     - “You can save your notebook by clicking on the floppy disk icon or using `Ctrl + S`. Remember, Jupyter also has an autosave feature.”
   - **Exporting Options**
     - “To download your notebook, go to 'File' and then 'Download as'. You can export it as a .py file for regular Python scripts or .html for sharing.”

#### 9. Managing the Kernel (3 minutes)
   - **Kernel Overview**
     - “The kernel is the Python instance that runs your code. If you encounter issues, like an infinite loop, you might need to restart it.”
   - **Restarting the Kernel**
     - “To restart, go to 'Kernel' and select 'Restart'. This stops all running processes and resets the kernel.”

#### 10. Accessing Help and Resources (2 minutes)
   - **Using the Help Menu**
     - “If you need assistance, click on the 'Help' menu for documentation and resources related to Jupyter and libraries you’ll be using.”
   - **Finding Keyboard Shortcuts**
     - “For a list of useful keyboard shortcuts, go to Help > Keyboard Shortcuts.”

#### 11. Conclusion and Q&A (1 minute)
   - **Wrap Up**
     - “That covers the basics of using Jupyter Notebooks. Explore the notebooks we have and practice on your own.”
   - **Open for Questions**
     - “If you have any questions, feel free to ask or post in the Q&A forum!”
