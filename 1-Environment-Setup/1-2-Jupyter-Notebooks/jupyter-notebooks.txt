# 2 ways to start jupyter notebook is 
#1. by running anaconda UI and running jupyter notebook
#2. Open command prompt, cd to the directory where you want to save notebooks and run "jupyter notebook" command there


Let's go ahead and explore the notebooks as well as get a feel for how to effectively use them.
I'm going to go ahead and just remind you how you can open up a Jupiter notebook.
I'm going to go ahead and jump to the command prompt now.
All right.
Here I am at my command prompt as a reminder if you're using Mac OS.
Go ahead and just use your terminal for this.
If you're using Windows just go ahead and come over here and type in ACMD and select your command prompt
.
There's also in an icon the command prompt you can use that as well.
That's the command prompt that comes with the Anaconda distribution.
All right.
So you go ahead and come to the command prompt and then type in j u p y t r space notebook and hit enter
.
Keep in mind this is going to start a Jupiter notebook wherever you are in the command prompt.
So for instance I'm going to delete this real quick.
I am under C users and then my middle name here Marysia and that's where my notebook is going to get
started.
If I want to start my notebooks in another directory I need to change directory the way I can change
directory is by using CD and then typing in the next file that I want.
So let's say I wanted to go to my downloads folder because that's where I downloaded the zip file.
I could start typing in D O N then you can actually tab autocomplete this and then it should take you
to.
If you go out and click enter now downloads and then I could type in DUPERE notebook enter and run this
and now my Jubran notebook file is going to be when I show it in my browser under the downloads folder
.
If you want to go ahead and go back up one folder you can type in CD.
That's change the rectory space dot dot and that will take you back up one directory.
You can go ahead and just look up basic command prompt lines.
There are a little different.
The penny for using Mac OS or Windows for instance if you want to see all the directory folders and
your current directory in Windows that's d I are the C directory.
And this basically shows you all the files here in your current directory.
If you are on Mac you can type in L S for list all of them.
All right then to clear everything you have here.
If you're on Windows you can just type in C L S.
If you're on a Mac and type in the word clear let me go ahead and start the Jupiter note book and when
to hit enter and it's going to open up a chip in a notebook in my browser.
Here it is.
I'm going to go ahead and find where I actually saved the unzips file.
Here it is python data science machine learning boot camp and the Pentagon unzip program you used.
You may or may not have this dasht master at the end but if you go ahead and click on this folder you'll
see quite a few folders here.
Python for data analysis for data visualization.
Python crash course machine learning sections data kept some projects big data and Sparc and more.
The very first section is under this folder.
Python crash course if you click on that section where that folder you'll have the notebook.
And here you see the dot IPY and be files.
So pretty much for every lecture where you see me coding something out there is a folder that has the
overall section name and then they'll be a subfolder of the actual section name and then the notebook
files which correspond to the lecturer names.
So the very first one is python crash course.
You can go ahead and click on this.
They'll take a little time to load.
Here it is and then everything I'll be typing out throughout the lecture is here for you and pretty
much at the beginning of every section of the course.
I'll remind you on where you can find the actual note books for that section of the Course answers quite
a few lectures and it may be hard to find it sometimes.
I'll be there to guide you and if you ever have any questions on where to find things

I'll be there to guide you and if you ever have any questions on where to find things All right then after that we'll start Python for data analysis.
You'll start the number by s.c or click on PI and see it notebook's for that.
Let me go ahead and just walk through how the Jupiter note book system works in a general sense.
I'm going to go all the way back up to the master and then I'm going to click new and here since I have
kind of several environments.
I'm going to click this one but you can click Python or Python 3 or whatever it's good and click on
it should be fine.
Again you can just click new whatever it says in notebooks.
You should be fine to click on it.
You'll get something like this to retitle this notebook.
You don't just click here under the untitled section and name it whatever you want.
My notebook for instance click OK and I'll name it.
Let me go ahead and show you the basics.
This is a code cell which means I can type in Python code into the cell and then run it as a very basic
example I can say prints hello and then I can run the cell by clicking here on run and Ill go ahead
and run and show me the output below the cell.
I can also do the same thing for basically any Python code if I wanted to know what one plus one is
.
I just click run here and it shows me the output in the cell notice since I printed the output here
it didn't show out since I didn't actually specify to print the output.
It showed the output cell.
The facts he said prints one plus one.
Then it wouldn't show that little out.
OK.
So you don't always have to come up here and click this run cell which you can do is actually just to
shift enter.
And that's when I put it as a string shift enter.
And if I do shift enter it will go ahead and run whatever is in that cell.
So keep that in mind.
That's a really nice way to just run stuff quickly so you don't have to constantly come over here and
click run sell.
Another little trick is alt enter.
If I do shift and turn on this it just goes down to the next cell.
But if I do alt enter it will actually insert a cell below it as well.
So notice the difference here.
If I just do shift enter on this first cell it runs it.
And that is how the n changes its number to show you the order of stuff and how it's been run.
Then if I do enter it actually inputs a cell for me.
That's a really nice trick and I'll show you why later on when we discuss exercises.
OK.
Now you may be wondering how can I save this notebook.
Can either do control s or click here on the little floppy disk save actually has an autosave feature
surround every two minutes auto save.
Or you can just say file and you can do a save and checkpoint here.
Now you may also be wondering how do I download this notebook as something else.
Well you can just go to file download as.
And you actually have a bunch of options here to download.
If you just want the dot PI file you can just say download as a dot PI and it will download and convert
this notebook file into a file so you can use it as a normal Python script and whatever ID you want
.
Or if you just want the HVM Elano you can click on each T.M. and it will export it to a basic a simple
file that any browser can show.
So you have a bunch of options.
You can go in and check them out.
Something else I want you to know is if you ever have for instance an infinite while loop running.
So let's just say this is like running forever and you want to somehow restart your kernel.
What will happen is under this in me zoom in a bit instead of a number here and end you'll see a low
Asterix.
It'll just be running forever.
What you can do is just go in and say kernel and then restart the kernel say do you want to restart
the kernel.
You go ahead and restart.
Well say restarting kernel and then I'll say kernel ready.
Basically what happens is this notebook is connected to a kernel and a kernel is kind of just an instance
of Python running.
And if something's wrong where Python is crashing maybe you actually wrote a script that just infinitely
loops or takes a really long time.
You can always just stop everything by coming over to kernel and clicking restart can also interrupt
if you just want to interrupt that specific cell but sometimes it doesn't work.
If you get a really bad while loop that runs forever just keep that in mind.
OK.
If you ever need help in addition to everything I just told you here you can always just click help
and then they'll give you help on a lot of the libraries.
We're going to be working with as well as just notebook helping click on that it will send you to a
link where it tells you about the notebooks themselves.
Keep in mind these notebooks used to be called I Python notebooks but now since Jupiter can run other
languages such as Juliet and are they're called the Jupiter notebooks.
Now another thing I wanted to mention is there's more keyboard shortcuts than what I just told you.
You can go to help click on keyboard shortcuts and it will give you a list of all the keyboard shortcuts
that are available to you.
All right.
That's really the basics of the notebook and pretty much all you need to know as far as you go through
this course.
You have any questions that are more specific to a particular topic that you can't find the help here
.
Go ahead and search to Kewaunee forums.
If you can't find that there or in the fake Q Feel free to post the new questions to the Q&A forums
and I'll be happy to help you out.
Real quick I wanted to show you what exercises look like throughout this course.
So for instance let's say you go a python for data analysis.
You're on the PI section of the Course you've done the lectures and you're ready to begin the exercise
.
Every exercise will have solutions file associated with it.
Don't check out the solutions file first.
You should check out this exercise file.
Then you can go ahead and click on the sexercise file and this one will pop up and look something like
this.
And this exercise file will have questions for you.
And then a cell where you can go ahead and answer those questions and a lot of times.
I'll also show you the expected output.
So for instance here you want to create an array of zeros.
Now I know you probably don't know how to do that yet but keep in mind that if you start typing stuff
in the cell such as prints hello and run this you'll overwrite the output.
So just keep that in mind and there will be more relevant when you actually get to the exercises.
Some of you may be wondering is what kind of cell is this.
The actually just shows text and isn't a code cell.
Well this is known as a markdown cell.
If we go ahead and go back to my notebook here everything I've shown you so far is a code cell.
But what's really awesome about Jupiter notebooks is you can type in notes for yourself in normal markdown
text so you can come over here look on code.
Click on markdown and it will convert this into a markdown cell.
And now if I run the cell it's essentially just basic text for me to type notes for myself which is
really useful when you're learning.
You can say something like.
Use print to print strings.
Run that little note for yourself and then you can go ahead and type in prints hello etc. and that's
a really nice way to kind of take notes as you go along throughout the lectures and this also supports
a markdown formatting.
So if you're familiar of markdown formatting such as how to use hash tags for bold etc..
Or maybe do a taluk with just a couple of asterisks lips.
More bullet points or indentation for a kind of code formatting that's also ported in these markdown
cells.
Now we won't go over marked down syntax because I can be a whole nother course but just keep in mind
if I see something like this type mark down and latex that says it's a markdown cell.
A common mistake sometimes beginners make is they'll accidently convert this to a markdown cell and
then wonder hey why isn't my code running.
If your code is ever not highlighted it probably means that you're only running a markdown cell.
If you want to change this markdown cell back to a code cell just come up here and select code then
run this with a shift enter and you're good to go.
OK so remember shift enter runs a cell and then Alt Enter will run a cell and output a cell below it
.
So if you go ahead and click alternate are here so like do again Alt Alt center and in putting a new
cell.
Now I'm just referring to what I'm actually doing on my keyboard not want to typing in a string.
So again one plus one shift enter it runs it one plus one alternator.
It keeps putting in new cells below it which is really useful for exercises.
So if you come back here this is exercise.
Notice I have this output array 1 1 1 on 1.
I don't want to overwrite that.
I can just click on this text or mark down cell do enter and it gives me a little cell here for a buffer
so I can prints whatever I want.
Shift enter in outputs test.
All right.
Don't worry if you didn't completely get all of that because we're going to review all this when we
actually get to the exercises.
All right.
That's basically all you need to know for the Jupiter note books.
If you have any questions feel free to post and Q&A forums.
You know I'll be happy to help you out.
Just keep in mind that the Jupiter notebook system will start wherever you were in your command prompt
or your terminal.
You'll need a change directory using CD if you want to run or save your notebooks in another place in
your computer.
All right thanks everyone and I'll see at the next lecture.
