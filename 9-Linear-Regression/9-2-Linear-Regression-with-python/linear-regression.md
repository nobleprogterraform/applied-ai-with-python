### Introduction
Hello everyone and welcome to the linear regression with Python lecture. Now that we've learned about the theory behind linear regression, let's go ahead and use scikit-learn to implement our own linear regression models. We'll start off by working with a housing data set, trying to create a model to predict housing prices based on existing features. 

### Course Progression
Just linear regression is our first machine learning algorithm. We'll work with some artificially created data sets
 Right now, we don't want to focus too much on cleaning the data; we'll focus on that aspect later. For now, we just want to get the basics of creating the model correct.

### Setting Up
Let's go ahead and jump to the notebook to get started. Here I am at the Jupyter notebook. We're going to be working with the USA Housing CXXVI file, 

### Importing Libraries

We'll start by importing the necessary libraries:
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
```
Then, to see these visualizations in the notebook, I need to specify matplotlib in line.

### Exploring the Data
OK. Let's go ahead and check out our data. I'm going to create a DataFrame called `DMF` and say:
```python
DMF = pd.read_csv('usa_housing.csv')
```
Now, let's check the head of the DataFrame. In this DataFrame, we have a couple of columns. Each row represents a particular house at a certain address (which is the last column), and the house sold for a particular price. The other columns represent statistics for the city or area that the house is located in, such as the city's population, the average number of bedrooms for houses in that area, the average number of rooms, the average house age, and the average income for the houses in that area.

### Data Overview
Keep in mind that the state is artificially created, which is why we have such significant digits after the decimal point; usually, we're not going to have that much accuracy. Let's go ahead and explore this data just a little bit. I would recommend you check out the `info` method on your DataFrame to inform you of the total number of columns and entries, as well as provide hints on what type of objects are in the DataFrame.

Another thing to recommend is to call the `describe` method on your DataFrame to get a quick statistical overview, such as the mean, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation of the columns. Notice that the address column is not available because that was a string value. If you ever need to reference the column names, you can just say `DMF.columns` to return a list of the column names.

### Data Visualization
Let's do some simple plots to check out the data. One very simple plot you can do if the data isn't too large is `seaborn.pairplot`, which will automatically create histograms of all the columns and correlation scatter plots. 

Now, let's check out the distribution of one of the columns. We usually want to check the distribution of our target column, which in this case is the price of the house. Let's check out the distribution of the price. It looks like the average price falls somewhere around the 1 million mark, between 1 and 1.5 million, and everything looks to be normally distributed from there.

You may also want to create a heat map of the correlation between each of the columns. You can say `DMF.corr()` to get the correlation matrix and then plot that out as a heat map using `sns.heatmap()`.

### Preparing the Data
OK, let's shift our focus now to actually using scikit-learn and training a linear regression model. The first step is to split our data into an X array that contains the features to train on and a Y array with the target variable, which is the price column we're trying to predict. We will toss out the address column because it contains text information that the linear regression model can't use. 

I'll grab my column names from `DMF.columns` and then set X equal to `DMF` with a list of the column names. Y will be my target variable, which is the price column.

### Train-Test Split
Now that we have our X and Y data, the next step is to do a train-test split. We want to split our data into a training set for the model and a testing set to test the model once it has been trained. Let's use scikit-learn to do this. Scikit-learn comes with a `train_test_split` function. 

You can grab it by saying:
```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
```
Whenever you're working with a new function, I like to do `Shift + Tab` in the Jupyter notebook to read the documentation string for it. 

Now, let’s set our test size to 0.4 (40%) and specify a random state of 101 to ensure consistent random splits. 

### Model Creation and Training
Now that we have our training and testing data, we need to create and train the model. We'll import the linear regression model:
```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
```
After importing, we instantiate our linear regression model with:
```python
lm = LinearRegression()
```
Next, we fit our model to the training data:
```python
lm.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

### Model Evaluation
Now, let's evaluate our model by checking out its coefficients and interpreting them. We can print the intercept:
```python
intercept = lm.intercept_
```
Then, check the coefficients:
```python
coefficients = lm.coef_
```
Let’s create a DataFrame based on these coefficients to organize this information better.

### Coefficient Interpretation
Each coefficient relates to the columns in X or X_train. For example, if we hold all other features fixed, a one-unit increase in average area income is associated with an increase of $21,052 in price. For the average house age, a one-year increase is associated with an increase of $164,883 in price.

### Conclusion
Now, you may wonder if this actually makes sense. This is artificially created data, so the conclusions may not be realistic. If you want to analyze real data, you can use the california dataset:
```python
fetch_california_housingfrom sklearn.datasets import fetch_california_housing
df = fetch_california_housing()
df
```
You can load the california dataset, check its description, and grab the feature names and target prices.




### Making Predictions

What you can do is say:
```python
predictions = L-M.predict(X_test)
```
In this case, we want to pass in features that the model has never seen before, so we pass in `X_test`, which is the testing set. Then we can go ahead and check out the predictions. 

If we just look at the array of predictions, these are the predicted prices of the houses. However, since we did the train-test split, we know that `y_test` contains the correct prices of the houses. We want to know how far off our predictions are from the actual prices.

### Visual Analysis

There is one quick way to visually analyze this, which is just by doing a scatterplot:
```python
plt.scatter(y_test, predictions)
```
If they line up like this, you know you've done a pretty good job. A perfect straight line would indicate perfectly correct predictions, so a little deviation from the straight line is actually a very good job.

---

### Analyzing Residuals

Let’s go ahead and create a histogram of the distribution of our residuals. I'm going to say:
```python
sns.histplot(y_test - predictions)
```
The residuals are the difference between the actual values `y_test` and the predicted values. This will create a histogram of the residuals. Notice here that our residuals look to be normally distributed. That’s a very good sign; if you have normally distributed residuals, it means your model was a correct choice for the data.

### Regression Evaluation Metrics

Next, let’s discuss regression evaluation metrics. There are three common evaluation metrics for regression problems. 

1. **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: The mean of the absolute value of the errors.
2. **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: The mean of the squared errors.
3. **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: The square root of the mean of the squared errors.

These are all variations on the difference between what you predicted and the true values.

---

### Comparing Metrics

MAE is the easiest to understand; it’s just your average error. MSE is more popular because it punishes larger errors, which can be more useful in the real world. RMSE is even more popular than MSE because it’s interpretable in the original Y units, meaning you can directly interpret RMSE in the units of your target variable.

All of these values are something we want to minimize to create the best model.

---

### Calculating Metrics

Let’s go back and finish calculating these metrics in our notebook. 

You can calculate all of these by importing metrics:
```python
from sklearn import metrics
```
You can say:
```python
mae = metrics.mean_absolute_error(y_test, predictions)
mse = metrics.mean_squared_error(y_test, predictions)
rmse = np.sqrt(mse)
```
And print them out. 

---

### Conclusion

That brings us to a conclusion for our linear regression model. We were able to successfully take the data, split it into a training set and a testing set based on the features and the target.

We trained a linear model from Scikit-learn, fit the model, checked the coefficients and intercepts, made predictions, and analyzed our residuals.

You can explore the Boston dataset linked in your notebook if you want to redo this analysis on a real dataset.
