### Part 1: Setting Up Data

1. **Introduction**
   - **Overview**: In this section, we will set up our data for linear regression. We’ll read a data source, split it into features and labels, and then further divide those into training and test sets. This step is crucial for building a model that can generalize well to unseen data.
  
2. **Exploring the Question**
   - **Objective**: We aim to explore the relationship between advertising spending across different channels—TV, radio, and newspaper—and sales figures. This investigation will help us understand if investing in certain advertising channels yields better sales outcomes.
   - **Importance**: Understanding these relationships can guide strategic decisions in marketing investments.

3. **Data Visualization**
   - **Purpose**: Before diving into modeling, it’s beneficial to visualize the data. Scatter plots can help us identify patterns and correlations between advertising spend and sales.
   - **Code Explanation**:
     ```python
     import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
     import seaborn as sns

     # Create scatter plots for visual exploration
     sns.pairplot(df, x_vars=['TV', 'radio', 'newspaper'], y_vars='sales')
     plt.show()
     ```
   - **What This Does**: The `sns.pairplot` function creates a grid of scatter plots, comparing each advertising channel against sales. This helps us visually assess which channels appear to have a stronger relationship with sales.

4. **Preparing the Data**
   - **Splitting Features and Labels**: We need to separate our dataset into features (the input variables) and labels (the output variable we want to predict).
   - **Code Explanation**:
     ```python
     X = df.drop('sales', axis=1)
     Y = df['sales']
     ```
   - **Details**: Here, `X` contains all the columns except 'sales', representing our features (TV, radio, and newspaper spending), while `Y` contains the sales figures. This separation is essential for training our model.

### Part 2: Train-Test Split

1. **Introduction to Train-Test Split**
   - **Concept**: To evaluate our model effectively, we must separate our data into a training set and a test set. The model learns from the training set and is evaluated on the test set to check its performance on unseen data.
   - **Why It Matters**: This separation helps prevent overfitting, where the model performs well on the training data but poorly on new data.

2. **Understanding Train-Test Split**
   - **Code Explanation**:
     ```python
     from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

     X_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test = train_test_split(X, Y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)
     ```
   - **Breakdown**: 
     - `test_size=0.3` means 30% of the data will be reserved for testing, while 70% will be used for training.
     - `random_state=42` ensures that the split is reproducible. Using the same random state allows us to generate the same split if we run the code multiple times.

3. **Checking Split Sizes**
   - **Purpose**: After performing the train-test split, it’s important to verify that the sizes of the training and test sets are as expected.
   - **Code Explanation**:
     ```python
     print(len(X_train), len(X_test))  # Expecting 140, 60 for a dataset of 200 rows
     ```
   - **Details**: This will output the number of samples in each set, confirming that we have correctly allocated the data.

### Part 3: Creating and Training the Model

1. **Importing the Model**
   - **Objective**: We will now import the linear regression model from the scikit-learn library, which is a powerful tool for machine learning in Python.
   - **Code Explanation**:
     ```python
     from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
     ```

2. **Model Initialization**
   - **Purpose**: We create an instance of the linear regression model. This step sets up the model that we will train on our data.
   - **Code Explanation**:
     ```python
     model = LinearRegression()
     ```
   - **Details**: By initializing `LinearRegression()`, we prepare the model for training. At this stage, it has default parameters, which we can adjust later if needed.

3. **Fitting the Model**
   - **Training the Model**: We need to train our model using the training data, which involves learning the relationship between the features and the target variable (sales).
   - **Code Explanation**:
     ```python
     model.fit(X_train, Y_train)
     ```
   - **What Happens Here**: The `fit` method trains the model on `X_train` and `Y_train`. After this step, the model has learned the coefficients that represent the relationship between advertising spends and sales.

### Part 4: Making Predictions and Evaluating Performance

1. **Making Predictions**
   - **Goal**: Once our model is trained, we can use it to predict sales based on the test set of features. This step is crucial for evaluating the model’s performance.
   - **Code Explanation**:
     ```python
     predictions = model.predict(X_test)
     ```
   - **Details**: The `predict` method uses the test features (`X_test`) to generate predictions for sales, which we can then compare against the actual sales in `Y_test`.

2. **Evaluating Model Performance**
   - **Next Steps**: To understand how well our model performs, we’ll need to evaluate its predictions. This evaluation involves comparing predicted values to actual values using various performance metrics.
   - **Introduction to Metrics**: Common metrics for regression tasks include Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.next, we’ll discuss these metrics in detail and implement them using scikit-learn.



#### Introduction to Performance Evaluation

1. **Welcome Back**
   - We’re continuing our discussion on model evaluation, focusing specifically on regression metrics. After fitting a regression model using SciKit-Learn, it’s crucial to assess how well it predicts outcomes based on the features.

2. **Understanding Regression**
   - **Regression vs. Classification**: Regression tasks involve predicting continuous values, while classification tasks predict categorical outcomes. For instance, predicting a house price based on its features is a regression task, while predicting the country a house belongs to based on its features is a classification task.

3. **Importance of Evaluation Metrics**
   - Common metrics like accuracy and recall aren’t suitable for regression models. Instead, we need metrics specifically designed for continuous values. 

#### Key Regression Metrics

1. **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
   - **Definition**: MAE measures the average magnitude of errors in a set of predictions, without considering their direction. It is calculated as follows:
     - Formula: 
       \[
       \text{MAE} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} |Y_i - \hat{Y}_i|
       \]
     - Here, \(Y_i\) is the true value, \(\hat{Y}_i\) is the predicted value, and \(N\) is the total number of predictions.
   - **Pros and Cons**: While MAE is straightforward and easy to interpret, it doesn’t heavily penalize large errors, which can be a limitation in certain scenarios.

2. **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
   - **Definition**: MSE takes the average of the squares of the errors, thus penalizing larger errors more than MAE:
     - Formula: 
       \[
       \text{MSE} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (Y_i - \hat{Y}_i)^2
       \]
   - **Pros and Cons**: MSE effectively highlights large discrepancies but reports error in squared units (e.g., dollars squared), making it less intuitive.

3. **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
   - **Definition**: RMSE is the square root of MSE, bringing the error back to the same units as the original values:
     - Formula:
       \[
       \text{RMSE} = \sqrt{\text{MSE}}
       \]
   - **Interpretation**: RMSE is often preferred because it provides a direct sense of the error magnitude and punishes larger errors effectively.

4. **Contextualizing Error Metrics**
   - Understanding what constitutes a “good” value for MAE or RMSE depends on the specific context of your data. For example, an RMSE of $10 might be excellent for predicting house prices, but unacceptable for candy bar prices.

#### Evaluating the Model Using Python

1. **Setting Up the Evaluation**
   - After fitting the linear regression model, we will evaluate its performance using the test data.

2. **Importing Required Libraries**
   ```python
   import numpy as np
   from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error, mean_squared_error
   ```

3. **Making Predictions**
   - We will use the fitted model to predict sales based on the test features.
   ```python
   test_predictions = model.predict(X_test)
   ```

4. **Calculating Evaluation Metrics**
   - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
     ```python
     mae = mean_absolute_error(Y_test, test_predictions)
     print("Mean Absolute Error:", mae)
     ```

   - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
     ```python
     mse = mean_squared_error(Y_test, test_predictions)
     print("Mean Squared Error:", mse)
     ```

   - **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
     ```python
     rmse = np.sqrt(mse)
     print("Root Mean Squared Error:", rmse)
     ```

5. **Understanding the Results**
   - When interpreting the results, consider the distribution of your target variable (sales) to gauge whether the calculated errors (MAE, MSE, RMSE) are acceptable relative to the average sales value.

#### Conclusion and Next Steps

1. **Importance of Multiple Metrics**
   - Using both MAE and RMSE provides a comprehensive understanding of model performance. If MAE is acceptable but RMSE is high, it indicates that while most predictions are close, there are a few significant outliers.

2. **Future Considerations**
   - In the next lecture, we will delve deeper into residual analysis to further validate our choice of linear regression as an appropriate modeling technique.

Certainly! Here’s the structured summary of the lecture with organized Python code snippets included:

---

#### Model Training and Coefficient Analysis
- **Final Model Creation:**
   ```python
   from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

   # Create a new model instance
   final_model = LinearRegression()

   # Fit the model on the entire dataset
   final_model.fit(X, y)  # X and y represent the full dataset
   ```

- **Understanding Coefficients:**
   ```python
   # Access the coefficients
   coefficients = final_model.coef_
   print("Coefficients:", coefficients)
   ```

   - **Coefficient Interpretation:**
     - Example: Newspaper spend has a coefficient close to zero, indicating it doesn’t significantly affect sales.
     - Positive coefficients for TV and Radio suggest a direct relationship with sales.

#### Visualization and Interpretation
- **Coefficient Interpretation:**
   - Positive coefficients indicate an increase in sales with increased spend, while negative coefficients indicate a decrease.
   - Zero coefficients suggest a feature is not contributing to the model.

- **Limitations of Visualization:**
   - Visualizing relationships with more than three features becomes complex and is often not feasible.

#### Model Persistence: Saving and Loading
- **Saving a Model:**
   ```python
   from joblib import dump

   # Save the trained model
   dump(final_model, 'final_sales_model.joblib')
   ```

- **Loading a Model:**
   ```python
   from joblib import load

   # Load the saved model
   loaded_model = load('final_sales_model.joblib')
   ```

#### Predicting New Data
- **Example Prediction:**
   ```python
   import numpy as np

   # Create a new advertising campaign (2D shape)
   new_campaign = np.array([[149, 22, 12]])  # TV, Radio, Newspaper spends

   # Predict expected sales using the loaded model
   predicted_sales = loaded_model.predict(new_campaign)
   print("Predicted Sales:", predicted_sales)
   ```

- **Performance Metrics:**
   - The model's performance metrics (mean absolute error and root mean squared error) provide an estimate of prediction accuracy.
