### Introduction
Welcome everyone to this lecture on the Machine Learning Pathway. What I want to discuss in this lecture is just a general idea of a pathway of using machine learning and data science for useful real-world applications, such as creating a data report or creating a data product. 

It's just a general concept overview and hopefully something to guide you as far as reading further discussions on machine learning and various roles within data science. And lastly, keep in mind that we're going to be covering all these steps and topics in depth throughout the course. This is just a high-level overview of the general process and pathway that utilizes a machine learning model and data analysis in general.

### Starting with Real-World Problems
When we actually get to running machine learning models with Python, we're gonna do a much deeper dive as far as what the machine learning process looks like for things like supervised learning versus unsupervised learning. This is basically just showing you how to start from the real world and then create a data product or perform data analysis.

So let's go ahead and begin our discussion of what we're calling this machine learning pathway. To begin, it all starts with the real world,  There are two situations in general that we're going to encounter: we either have a problem that we need to solve or a question that we need to answer. 

So to label these in a general sense, it could be something like, how do I fix or change X out in the real world? That could be a problem I need to solve, or there could be a question I need to answer. So maybe I'm curious about how the change in X affects Y out in the real world. 

### Creating Data Products vs. Data Analysis
What we need to do is create what we're gonna call a data product or perform data analysis. While there's clearly some overlap here between a data product and data analysis, it's important to separate these out in your mind to fully understand the pathway. 

A data product could be something like a mobile app, a service, or a website, dashboards, and so on. Data analysis falls a little lower than that; it includes things like reports, visualizations, and communications. Obviously, any sophisticated data product probably includes data analysis within it.

### Collecting and Storing Raw Data
So, the main idea is how we can get from the real world to a data product or data analysis and then hopefully use that to affect change in the real world for the betterment of humanity. 

First, from the real world, we need actual raw data. This can come from a wide variety of sources, including physical sensors, surveys, experiments, or tracking data usage on someone's cell phone or website. 

There are lots of different ways we can get this actual raw data, and we then have to process and store this data. We can store it in SQL databases, CSV files, Excel, cloud storage, etc. Depending on the data format, where the data's coming from, and the size of the data, different options will be better than others. 

In general, we're going to label this process of gathering raw data and processing it as falling under the realm of data engineering. So let's combine these two blocks to save a little space, and we'll say that our data engineering step along this pathway is to collect and then store that data.

### Cleaning and Organizing Data
After we've collected and stored the data, we're going to need to clean and organize that data. A lot of data analysis methods and many machine learning models require your data to be in a specific format. Cleaning and organizing the data includes dealing with potentially missing data and restructuring your data so that features and labels are organized correctly for your machine learning model. 

There will be some overlap between collecting and storing your data and cleaning and organizing your data. A good organization with solid data engineering should consider both aspects. 

### Exploratory Data Analysis
Once you've cleaned and organized your data, the next step is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA). This can involve statistical analysis or visualizations to explore populations. This step is generally called data analysis, and roles associated with it can include data analyst or data scientist. 

If we were just trying to answer a question, this may be all we need to do. In general, if you perform some exploratory data analysis and you were trying to answer a question based on the data you collected, this is probably going to be enough. 

### Reporting Results
After performing data analysis, you will create a report or visualization, or simply communicate those results to decision-makers. This is where we hope to make decisions or answer questions that can affect the real world.

### Moving to Machine Learning
What if we need to continue and create a data product? In that case, after the exploratory data analysis, we move on to the machine learning section. We take our clean data and explore it to understand different trends and visualizations, and we're ready to perform either supervised or unsupervised learning. 

Supervised learning attempts to predict a future outcome based on historical labeled data, while unsupervised learning helps us discover hidden patterns or gain insights into the data. 

### Final Steps in the Pathway
After creating successful machine learning models, we can use them to create a service, dashboard, or application. These elements are often part of some sort of data product. Once we've run the machine learning models and are satisfied with them, we can create a data product that can predict future outcomes or reveal insights that weren't visible before without machine learning.

### Conclusion
So, this right here is our general machine learning pathway: we collect and store the data, clean and organize it, perform exploratory data analysis, and if necessary, create a machine learning model to build a data product that goes back into the real world. This cyclical process starts over again. 

Now that we understand the general dynamics of the data science and machine learning pathway, we can begin to focus on learning various Python libraries well-suited for each of these major components.
