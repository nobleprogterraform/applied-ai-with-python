### Introduction to NumPy
The first Python data science library we will be learning about is NumPy. What's really interesting about NumPy is that pretty much every data science library we learn about in this course, whether it's SciKit Learn, Pandas, or Seaborn, is actually built off the base of NumPy.

### Section Goals
Let's go ahead and explore what this section will be covering, our goals, and why it's important to learn about NumPy. The section goals are to:
1. Understand what NumPy is.
2. Show how to create arrays with NumPy through various methods.
3. Retrieve information from NumPy arrays through slicing and indexing.
4. Learn about basic NumPy operations, such as universal functions.

Once we learn about all this, we'll test your new NumPy skills with exercise questions and then go over the solutions.

### What is NumPy?
Put simply, NumPy is a Python library for creating N-dimensional arrays. N-dimensional arrays mean that NumPy arrays can be structured from 1D to 2D to 3D to 4D, etc. In this course, we're typically dealing with either a one-dimensional vector or a two-dimensional array of data, but NumPy is expandable to any number of dimensions.

### Key Features of NumPy
What's really important about NumPy is its ability to quickly broadcast functions, and it also has a ton of built-in features for us, including linear algebra, statistical distributions, trigonometric functions, and random number capabilities.

### Why Use NumPy?
So why would you use NumPy? While NumPy structures at first look very similar to standard Python lists, they're actually much more efficient than just a Python list or even a nested Python list. The key to all of this is that the broadcasting capabilities are extremely useful for quickly applying functions to an entire dataset.
