### Introduction
Welcome back everyone to this lecture discussion on the bias-variance trade-off, which is also known as overfitting versus underfitting a model. Keep in mind that this is actually an important topic across all supervised machine 

### Choosing the Optimal Degree
So let's actually talk about what that means. We've seen already that a higher order polynomial model performs significantly better than a standard linear regression model from the previous project. But how can we actually choose the optimal degree for the polynomial? Should we go to the third degree, fourth degree, fifth degree? What's to stop us from going to a very large degree and accounting for each possible fluctuation in our data set? What trade-offs are we to consider as we increase model complexity?

### Bias-Variance Trade-off
In general, increasing model complexity in search for better performance leads to what is known as the bias-variance trade-off. We want to have a model that can generalize well to new unseen data but can also account for variance and patterns in the known training data. Extreme bias or extreme variance can both lead to really poor performing models.

### Visualizing Overfitting and Underfitting
To better understand bias versus variance and overfitting versus underfitting, we can visualize the effect by considering a model that has a high bias that is underfitting, or a model that overfits that is having a high variance.

#### Overfitting
Let's start with a model that overfits to a dataset. Overfitting is when the model fits too much to the noise or variance from the data. This often results in low error on training sets but high error on test or validation sets. This is why overfitting can sometimes be a little hard to catch because you may think your model's performing really well when in fact it's only performing well on the training set instead of performing well on unseen data.

Imagine a simple case where we have one single X feature and then a Y corresponding value. We want to create a model that fits this data. A good model is probably going to have something that looks a little logarithmic. If the model overfits, it means it's picking up too much noise from all the data. Visually, we can see this model is clearly not a good model choice. The actual error on the training data would be zero because it's hitting every single point, misleading you into thinking you have a great fitting model. However, when you get a new data point, it will have a very large error on the test dataset.

### Underfitting
Now, what's the opposite of overfitting? That is underfitting, when you have too much bias. In underfitting, the model does not capture the underlying trend of the data well enough and does not fit to the training data. So we have low variance but high bias. Underfitting is often a result of an excessively simple model. 

If we were to underfit, we might have a very simple model, such as just a linear fit. While it may perform well for certain training points, it will not fit well to either the training set or the test set, leading to poor performance.

### Detecting Overfitting and Underfitting
Overfitting can be harder to detect since good performance on training data could lead to a model that appears to be performing well. This particular dataset was easy to visualize because we only had one X feature. But what do we do when dealing with multi-dimensional data sets? If I have more than one X value, I won't be able to visually tell if my model's overfitting or underfitting.

### Error vs. Model Complexity
To assess model performance, we plot error versus model complexity. In polynomial regression, as you increase model complexity (polynomial degree), your error generally goes down. 

As you increase complexity, typically, the training error will decrease, but the test error will start to increase after a certain point. This is an ideal situation where you get similar performance on both training and test sets.

### Selecting the Right Model Complexity
To find the appropriate model complexity, plot model complexity against error for both the training and test sets. As complexity increases, the training error decreases, but if overfitting occurs, the test error will increase.

The goal is to choose a complexity where the test error starts to rise while the training error continues to decrease. Keep in mind that model complexity is a general term; in the case of polynomial regression, it directly relates to the degree of the polynomial.

### Conclusion
In the case of polynomial regression, complexity directly relates to the degree of the polynomial, but many machine learning algorithms have their own hyperparameters that can increase complexity. As we explore further, we'll see how to visualize these relationships and determine the ideal degree of polynomial to choose for our specific project.
